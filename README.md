# 🧠 Python Knowledge Hub
🔹 Hello World : A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen

🔹 Variables : A variable is a named storage that holds a value in memory

🔹 Data Types : Data types define the type of value a variable can store in Python

🔹 Inner Working of Python : Python converts code to bytecode and runs it on the PVM 

🔹 Import & Export : Import uses code from another file, export shares code for reuse

🔹 Implicit  &Explicit Type : Implicit happens by itself, explicit needs to be done manually

🔹 Python & Its Language Connections : Python works with C, C++, Java, and others for more features

🔹 Syntax : Rules that define how to write Python code correctly

🔹 pycache : A folder where Python stores compiled bytecode to speed up execution

🔹 Python Keywords : Special reserved words that cannot be used as variable names

🔹 Google Colab : An online platform to write and run Python code in the cloud

🔹 Comments : Notes in code that Python ignores, used for explanations

🔹 Python Features : Easy, open-source, cross-platform, and supports OOP & libraries

🔹 Input & Output : Input gets user data, output shows results

🔹 Escape Sequences : Special characters that format text, like \n for new lines and \t for tabs

🔹 Operators : Symbols that perform operations on values, like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`

🔹 Conditional Statements : Used to make decisions in code with `if`, `elif`, and `else`

🔹 Understanding Strings : Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes

🔹 Lists : Ordered, changeable collections of items enclosed in square brackets []

🔹 Sets : Unordered collections of unique items enclosed in {}

🔹 Dictionary : A collection of key-value pairs enclosed in {}

🔹 Tuples : Ordered, unchangeable collections of items enclosed in ()

🔹 Concatenation : Joining two or more strings or sequences together

🔹 Tokens in Python : Basic building blocks of code like keywords, identifiers, and operators

🔹 Loops : A way to repeat a task multiple times until a condition is false

🔹 Binary Data Types : Binary data types store 0s and 1s. bytes is fixed, bytearray can change

🔹 Number System : A number system is a way to represent and express numbers using a specific base or radix
