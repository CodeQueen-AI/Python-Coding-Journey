Welcome to Python Mastery Hub – Your gateway to mastering Python with clarity, fun, and real-world applications! Let’s code and conquer! 🎉🔥

# 🧠 Python Knowledge Hub
🔹 Hello World : A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen

🔹 Variables : A variable is a named storage that holds a value in memory

🔹 Data Types : Data types define the type of value a variable can store in Python

🔹 Inner Working of Python : Python compiles code to bytecode, then runs it on the PVM(Pyhton Virtual Machine)

🔹 Import and Export : Import means using code from another file, and export means sharing code for others to use

🔹 Implicit and Explicit Type : Implicit happens by itself, explicit needs to be done manually

🔹 Python and Its Language Connections :  Python connects with C, C++, Java, and more for better functionality

🔹 Syntax: Rules that define how to write Python code correctly

🔹 pycache: A folder where Python stores compiled bytecode to speed up execution

🔹 Python Keywords: Reserved words in Python that have special meanings and can't be used as variable names

🔹 Google Colab: An online platform to write and run Python code in the cloud

🔹 Comments: Notes in code that Python ignores, used for explanations

🔹 Python Features:Python is easy to read, open-source, cross-platform, and supports OOP, libraries, and automation.

🔹 Input & Output from Users : Input takes data from the user, and output displays results on the screen.

🔹 Escape Sequences: Special characters in strings that perform actions like new lines (`\n`) or tabs (`\t`).

🔹 Operators: Symbols that perform operations on values, like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

🔹 Conditional Statements: Used to make decisions in code with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

🔹 Understanding Strings: Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes

🔹 Lists: Ordered, changeable collections of items enclosed in square brackets []

🔹 Sets: Unordered collections of unique items enclosed in {}

🔹 Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs enclosed in {}

🔹 Tuples: Ordered, unchangeable collections of items enclosed in ()

🔹 Concatenation: Joining two or more strings or sequences together

🔹 Tokens in Python: The smallest units of code, including keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and symbols.
